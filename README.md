## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned that border-radius can be used like the code below while using a different device while before i got these code, i just happened to use border-top-left-radius and so on, but when i learned that i can use border-radius like right now, it makes me happy to learn that it is actually easier than i thought.

```html
<h1>Some code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  picture img {
    border-radius: 10px 0 0 10px;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 767px) {
  picture img {
    border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
  }
```

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this bootstrap and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
